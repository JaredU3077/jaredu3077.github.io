# neuOS Project - Issues Requiring Attention

This document lists files that require refactoring or improvement due to non-semantic HTML, high CSS specificity, outdated JS syntax, or other standards compliance issues.

## HTML Issues

- **index.html** - Missing semantic HTML5 elements for main content areas, should use `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>` instead of generic `<div>` elements
- **index.html** - Inline styles violate separation of concerns, should be moved to CSS files
- **index.html** - Missing proper ARIA landmarks for accessibility, needs `<nav>`, `<aside>`, `<main>` with appropriate roles

## CSS Issues

- **css/window.css** - High specificity selectors (1666 lines) causing maintenance issues, should be broken into smaller modules
- **css/animations.css** - Complex keyframe animations (877 lines) could be optimized for performance
- **css/glass.css** - Glassmorphic effects (725 lines) have redundant properties that could be consolidated
- **css/login.css** - Large file (910 lines) should be split into smaller, focused stylesheets
- **css/mobile.css** - Mobile-specific styles (698 lines) could be better organized with CSS custom properties

## JavaScript Issues

- **js/apps/terminal.js** - Extremely large file (2246 lines) violates single responsibility principle, should be split into multiple modules
- **js/core/window.js** - Complex window management (544 lines) could benefit from state management pattern
- **js/core/particleSystem.js** - Performance-critical code (642 lines) needs optimization for mobile devices
- **js/core/backgroundMusic.js** - Audio management (521 lines) has tight coupling that could be improved with dependency injection
- **js/core/themeManager.js** - Theme system (487 lines) could use a more modular approach

## Architecture Issues

- **js/main.js** - Entry point (625 lines) has too many responsibilities, should delegate initialization to separate modules
- **js/config.js** - Configuration (494 lines) mixes concerns, should separate UI config from system config
- **sw.js** - Service worker (342 lines) could be optimized for better caching strategies

## Performance Issues

- **css/design-tokens.css** - Large CSS custom properties (293 lines) could impact initial render time
- **js/utils/glassEffects.js** - Glass effect calculations may cause layout thrashing on mobile devices
- **js/core/resizeHandler.js** - Resize handling (513 lines) needs debouncing optimization

## Accessibility Issues

- **index.html** - Missing proper focus management for keyboard navigation
- **js/apps/terminal.js** - Terminal output needs better screen reader support
- **css/animations.css** - Some animations may cause motion sickness, need `prefers-reduced-motion` support

## Security Issues

- **index.html** - Content Security Policy could be more restrictive
- **js/apps/terminal.js** - Command execution needs better input sanitization
- **sw.js** - Service worker cache strategy could be more secure

## Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate**: Split large files into smaller, focused modules
2. **High Priority**: Implement proper semantic HTML structure
3. **Medium Priority**: Optimize CSS for better performance
4. **Low Priority**: Add comprehensive accessibility features
5. **Ongoing**: Implement automated testing for all modules
