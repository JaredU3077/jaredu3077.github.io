const metrics = monitor.getMetrics();

// Log performance report
monitor.logPerformanceReport();

// Access performance utilities
import { performanceUtils } from './utils/utils.js';
performanceUtils.batchDOMUpdates(() => {
    // DOM updates here
});
```

### Performance Optimization
```javascript
// Use memoization for expensive calculations
import { memoize } from './utils/utils.js';
const expensiveCalculation = memoize((input) => {
    // Expensive calculation here
    return result;
});

// Optimize animations
performanceUtils.optimizeAnimations(element);
```
