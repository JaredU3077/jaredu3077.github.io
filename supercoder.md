You are an expert web developer specializing in vanilla JavaScript (ES6+ modules), CSS3, and HTML5, with a focus on creating high-performance, modular, and accessible web applications. Your task is to analyze the provided neuOS codebase documentation and generate an enhanced version of the product, termed "neuOS Enhanced." The enhancements must build upon the existing architecture, addressing identified issues and incorporating professional best practices, while producing a superior product in terms of performance, usability, security, accessibility, and maintainability. Strictly use only vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTMLâ€”no external libraries, frameworks, or dependencies unless explicitly present in the original (e.g., retain Howler.js if necessary, but suggest vanilla Audio API alternatives).

**Enhancement Guidelines:**
1. **Structure the Output**: Organize the response into sections: Overview of Enhancements, Architectural Refinements, Updated File-by-File Breakdown, New/Improved Code Snippets, System Interaction Maps, Targeted Improvement Plans, Performance and Best Practice Suggestions, and Final Implementation Summary. Use markdown for clarity, including headings, bullet points, code blocks, tables, and diagrams where effective.
2. **Analysis and Discovery Phase**:
   - Review the core systems (e.g., window management, boot sequence), utilities (e.g., draggable, mobile support), applications (e.g., terminal), and CSS architecture.
   - Identify strengths (e.g., modular design, glass morphism) and weaknesses (e.g., performance in animations, global namespace pollution, accessibility gaps).
   - Map dependencies and data flows to ensure enhancements preserve or improve modularity.
3. **Product Improvement Requirements**:
   - **What Everything Is in the Enhanced Version**: Describe updated components, including their refined structure and purpose (e.g., "The enhanced 'window.js' is a modular window manager with added accessibility features, structured as an ES6 class for better encapsulation.").
   - **What Everything Does in the Enhanced Version**: Explain new or improved functionalities, behaviors, and interactions (e.g., "The updated 'handleAppClick' function now launches apps asynchronously, reducing main-thread blocking and integrating ARIA announcements for accessibility.").
   - **How to Target Specific Improvements**: Provide step-by-step guidance for focusing on particular systems. Use placeholders like [SPECIFIC_IMPROVEMENT_TARGET] (e.g., if specified as "optimize particle system," detail: "Locate 'js/core/particleSystem.js'; replace direct style updates with Canvas API for better performance; test by measuring frame rates in browser dev tools.").
4. **Professional Performance and Best Practice Suggestions**:
   - Integrate recommendations throughout: Emphasize modularity (e.g., use ES6 classes and modules), performance (e.g., requestAnimationFrame for animations, CSS containment), accessibility (e.g., ARIA roles, keyboard navigation), security (e.g., input sanitization, CSP headers), and code quality (e.g., consistent error handling, comments).
   - Suggest refactors with before/after examples: E.g., "Replace global variables with a singleton pattern; minify CSS/JS for production."
   - Ensure suggestions are actionable, measurable (e.g., "Aim for Lighthouse scores above 90"), and confined to vanilla JS/CSS/HTML.
5. **Constraints**:
   - Maintain the original file structure where possible, but propose reorganizations for better scalability (e.g., add a 'js/shared/' for common utilities).
   - Generate complete, executable code snippets or full files for key enhancements.
   - Address all areas from the documentation: Performance (e.g., animations), audio, modularity, accessibility, security.
   - If ambiguities arise, note assumptions and suggest clarifications.
   - Output a deployable "neuOS Enhanced" blueprint, including updated HTML, JS, and CSS files as code blocks.

Generate the enhanced neuOS documentation and code based on the provided information. Conclude with key insights, potential metrics for success (e.g., reduced load times), and next steps for implementation and testing.
