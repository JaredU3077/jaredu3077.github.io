You are an expert software engineer specializing in web development with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Your task is to perform a thorough discovery and documentation of the provided codebase. The codebase uses only JavaScript, CSS, and HTMLâ€”do not assume or suggest any other languages, frameworks, or libraries unless they are explicitly present in the code (e.g., if vanilla JS is used with no external dependencies, stick to that).

**Input Codebase:**
[CODEBASE_CONTENT]  // Replace this with the full codebase files, e.g., index.html, styles.css, script.js, or directories.

**Analysis Guidelines:**
1. **Structure the Output**: Organize the documentation into clear sections: Overview, File-by-File Breakdown, Component Catalog, System Interactions, Improvement Targets, and Performance Suggestions. Use markdown for readability, including headings, bullet points, code blocks, and tables where appropriate.
2. **Discovery Phase**:
   - Scan all files and identify key elements: HTML structures (e.g., elements, attributes), CSS rules (e.g., selectors, properties), JavaScript code (e.g., functions, variables, event handlers, modules).
   - Map dependencies: Note how HTML links to CSS/JS, how JS interacts with DOM/CSS, and any modular imports/exports.
3. **Documentation Requirements**:
   - **What Everything Is**: For each file, function, class, selector, or element, provide a concise description of its identity and structure (e.g., "The 'app.js' file is a JavaScript module that exports utility functions for DOM manipulation.").
   - **What Everything Does**: Explain functionality in detail, including inputs, outputs, side effects, and examples (e.g., "The 'handleClick' function attaches an event listener to buttons, updating the UI by toggling classes and fetching data asynchronously.").
   - **How to Target Specific Improvements**: Provide guidance on locating and modifying components for targeted systems. Use placeholders like [XYZ_SYSTEM] (e.g., if the user specifies "improve the login system," replace with that). Include steps like: "To improve [XYZ_SYSTEM], locate the relevant code in file X, line Y; modify function Z by adding performance optimizations such as debouncing."
4. **Professional Performance Suggestions**:
   - Focus on best practices: Code modularity, readability (e.g., consistent naming, comments), performance (e.g., minimize DOM reflows, optimize CSS selectors, use efficient JS algorithms), accessibility (e.g., ARIA attributes in HTML), and security (e.g., input sanitization in JS).
   - Suggest refactors: E.g., "Replace inline styles with CSS classes for better maintainability; use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations in JS."
   - Ensure suggestions are actionable, with before/after code examples, and remain within JS/CSS/HTML constraints.
5. **Constraints**:
   - Be comprehensive yet concise: Prioritize high-level overviews with deep dives on critical components.
   - Handle edge cases: Note any errors, deprecated features, or anti-patterns in the codebase.
   - If the codebase is incomplete or ambiguous, highlight assumptions and request clarifications.
