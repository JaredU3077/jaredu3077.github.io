## How to Test

1. **Copy the desired theme file** to your main CSS directory
2. **Include it in your HTML** after the main glass.css file
3. **Test the terminal and codex windows** to see the effect
4. **Choose your preferred theme** and let me know which one you like

## Current Desktop Widget Glass Properties

The desktop widget uses these exact properties:
- **Background:** `var(--glass-background)` (rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.008))
- **Backdrop-filter:** `blur(var(--glass-backdrop-blur)) saturate(var(--glass-saturation)) brightness(var(--glass-brightness))`
- **Blur:** 12px with 180% saturation and 140% brightness
- **Border:** `rgba(255,255,255,0.1)`
- **Shadow:** `0px 8px var(--outer-shadow-blur) rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15), var(--glass-edge-glow)`

## Recommendation

**Theme 6** is the most faithful to your request - it uses the EXACT same glass properties as the neuOS widget from _glass.css. This will give the terminal and codex windows the same frosted glass look that the widget has.

**Theme 5** is perfect for users who want maximum transparency and minimal visual interference.

**Theme 7** is ideal for users who want more pronounced glass effects while maintaining transparency.

**Theme 8** offers sophisticated reflection effects for a more realistic glass appearance.
